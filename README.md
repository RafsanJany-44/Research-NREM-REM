# Dataset Details
The dataset was collected from a sleep center named
Haaglanden Medisch Centrum (HMC, The Netherlands). The initial data files are combined with different types of
signals. We selected EEG and F4 from the frontal lobe and C4 from
the central lobe, and O2 from the occipital lobe. The frontal lobe control
the voluntary movements of the body. The thoughts and
Analytical activities are held from the central lobe. Occipital
Lob is responsible for the eyesight. To characterize the sleep
stages of a cerebral condition, the EEG is divided into five
frequency subbands: delta wave (0Hz–4Hz), theta wave (4Hz–8Hz), alpha wave (8Hz–12Hz), beta wave (12Hz–30Hz),
and gamma waves (30 Hz). Our dataset contains 154 sleep
recordings with 75 features. The dataset has five classifications: Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM. In the preprocessing step, all wake classified rows were removed, and N1, N2, N3 classes were merged into a single NREM class
